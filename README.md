  In top-to-bottom, right-to-left script (TB-RL or vertical), writing starts from the top of the page and continues to the bottom, proceeding from right to left for new lines, pages numbered from right to left. The **RtL Text** mode can be applied to some traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean books.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/single_column.png"> Single Column

  Some PDF books were scanned in a way that left and right pages were put in one image, resulting in a so called dual-spread page. In the scenario, **Single Column** mode plays a role. It splits a dual-spread page into two pages.

  The **WIDE** document restriction was removed now. **Single Column** mode can be a conveniency for magazines and scientific papers with two columns in a page.

  In **Single Column** mode, all pages except first and last page are splitted.

- Continuous scroll

  **Continuous scroll** has been perfectly implemented in all scenarios.

  When flinging or scrolling a zoomed page, it can hardly move in straight horizontal / vertical direction, and be annoying reading experience. Here the **Lock Stray** mode will make a help.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/crop_margin.png"> Crop Margin

  Crop page margins to get more efficient reading space. All document types are supported.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/focus.png"> Focus

  **Focus** mode can retent page position across zoomed pages. On moving to a definite page, ie. tap to next/prev page, tap content table, tap links, search text, navigate on page slider etc., it presents visible content area of new page in same position as the old one. Note that it does not work with scroll operation.

  On entering **Focus** mode, current page will zoom automatically to match screen in shorter dimension and center itself.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/smart_focus.png"> Smart Focus

  With scanned PDF books, content area scarcely appear exactly centered in a page. More probable it inclines toward left or right side. **Smart Focus** deals with the scenario. By adjusting the position of even or odd pages accordingly, it makes **Focus** mode behave smartly.

  **Smart Focus** must work with **Focus** mode to make sense.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/copy.png"> Copy Text

  **Text Copy** can be achived by selecting text and tap **Copy** button. In **Vertical Flip** mode, text selection can spread on multi-pages. It does not disturb page navigation.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/format.png"> Font size

  Current font size was indicated in **Font Size** menu.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/toc.png"> Table of Contents

  **Table of Contents** supports multi-level headings. Heading collapse and expand are also available. It always keep sync with current page.

- Scrollable Toobar

  The Scrollable Top Toolbar can accommodate more buttons. A button will show up when the corresponding function is appliable, otherwise it will be hidden.

- Pros and Cons

  In case of Big books (thousands of pages), PDFs were opened very quick, and EPUBs badly slow.
